				<ul>
					<li>For the first week Of code school I went to one meetup, SE Portland Coders Night (SEPoCoNi). It was super crowded and I talked to one person about rock climbing. There were a few women there which was an encouraging sign.</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
			<li class="pop">Forums</li>
				<ul>
					<li>During the first week I joined Github, codecademy, treehouse but haven't posted to any of the forums yet. I hope to post questions on Stack Overflow.</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
			<li class="pop">Friends</li>
				<ul>
				<li>The first week my partner reached out to an ex-co-worker that is working at a company the school will be touring next week. I also reached out to another friend who works for a company the school will be touring in two weeks. Added two friends as followers on Twitter, one is in school for graphic design and the other hopes to someday become a developer. I connected on FB to an ex-coworker who is a designer.</li>
