	<h1>Make A Plan</h1>

	<h2>Go to School? Online? Volunteer/Internship?</h2>
	<div class="plan">
	<p>I knew I wanted to quit my job. The hard part is TO DO WHAT? I had taken a few classes at a community college and the switch had indeed flipped that developing was the direction I wanted to go. Developing what? Ideally mobile? Mostly I could think of what I didn't want to do. I didn't want to work in the suburbs for a large company and work in a cubicle. Start-ups sounded interesting. But there seemed to be a ton of companies out there that did cool stuff but I had no idea what kind of things they actually did. Hopefully, with some tech speak in my pocket my understanding of these companies and jobs will grow.</p>
	<p>
		I lucked out around the time I seriously considered quitting my job that an opportunity arose with Portland Code School. I considered some other concepts, one of which was just teaching myself and trying to network on my own. Much cheaper but knew I could get really lost, would lose the immediate opportunity to meet businesses directly, and wouldn't have any help and guidence.</p>
	<p>
		I considered going back to accredited school for a CS degree but looking at my already current school loan debt, I quickly decided that seemed exhausting. Also, I wanted to learn what was happening right now and not the history of how we got there.</p>
	<p>
		So...pretty obvious: I went with PCS and for my first week I am required to make a 10 HTML pages and this is one of them! Meta meta meta.</p>

	<h1>Start Saving</h1>
	<div class="plan" id="save">
	<p>Money is awesome. That's one reason to become a developer. But how to get there?</p>
	<p>Save like you mean it!</p>
	<p>I saved up 3 months worth of rent plus a chunck of change</p>
	<p>I also paid off annoying debt knowing that I wouldn't be able to make payments during the transition</p>
